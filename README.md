# Scientific-Python-Project

This repository contains all the files created and applied for the final project of the Scientific Python course. It contains two python files and a neural network, which acts as the brain behind the reinforcement learning agent. The agent program contains the specifications of an agent which uses deep q-learning in order to solve the Lunar Lander environment. The Lunar lander file contains the program that applies this agent to the problem at hand and solves the environment. In this case by achieving over 200 points and successfully landing the lander.
